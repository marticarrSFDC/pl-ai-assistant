In a world where leveraging technology effectively can make a significant difference, this space aims to bring the power of AI to common people leadership tasks.

## Why This Repository?

As People Leaders, our time is precious, and our impact is profound. The goal of this repository is to:

* üöÄ **Boost Efficiency:** Provide ready-to-use or adaptable AI prompts and tool configurations that can save you time on administrative and preparatory tasks.
* ‚ú® **Enhance Quality & Consistency:** Offer structured approaches to common leadership activities like check-ins, feedback, and development planning.
* üí° **Inspire Innovation:** Showcase practical examples of how AI can be a valuable assistant in our day-to-day leadership responsibilities.
* ü§ù **Foster a Community:** Serve as a shared resource that we can all learn from, contribute to, and adapt for our unique team contexts.

## What You'll Find Inside

This repository aims to house a growing collection of individual AI-driven "projects" ‚Äì these could be standalone prompts, tool configurations, or small scripts. Each project will be contained in its own directory and will include:

* The core prompt(s) or tool files.
* A dedicated `README.md` file explaining the project, its use case, the prompt itself, LLMs tested, an optional sample reply, and the author, following a consistent template (see "Contributing" section below).

Examples of projects you might find:

* **Structured Prompt Systems:** Detailed systems for generating tailored agendas for recurring meetings like quarterly performance check-ins.
* **Feedback Generation Aids:** Prompts to help structure and articulate constructive feedback.
* **Goal-Setting Assistants:** Tools and prompts to guide conversations around objective setting.
* **Development Planning Prompts:** Resources to help facilitate discussions around Individual Development Plans (IDPs).
* **Meeting Preparation Tools:** Prompts to help outline agendas or talking points.

## Getting Started

1.  **Browse Projects:** Explore the repository. Each top-level directory within `/projects` (or similar, structure TBD) will represent a distinct tool or prompt set.
2.  **Review Project READMEs:** Open the `README.md` file within a project's directory to understand its purpose, see the prompt, and view sample outputs.
3.  **Adapt & Implement:** Copy, modify, and tailor the prompts or tools to your specific team, company culture, and personal leadership style.

## Contributing to `pl-ai-assistant`

We wholeheartedly welcome contributions from the People Leader community! If you have an AI prompt, a useful tool configuration, or a best practice for leveraging AI in your leadership role that you'd like to share, please consider adding it as a new project to this repository.

**How to Contribute:**

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a New Project Directory:**
    * Create a new directory for your project (e.g., `/projects/my-quarterly-feedback-prompt/`). The name should be descriptive.
    * Add your actual prompt files, scripts, or other assets related to your tool into this directory.
3.  **Add a Project README:**
    * Inside your new project's directory, create a `README.md` file.
    * This `README.md` file is crucial. It must be populated using the **"Project README Template"** detailed below. This ensures consistency and makes it easy for others to understand and use your contribution.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your project directory is complete with all files and its own detailed `README.md`, submit a pull request from your forked repository to this main repository. We'll review it and merge it if it aligns with the repository's goals.

**Project README Template:**

The `README.md` file within *each individual project directory* should follow this template:

```markdown
# [[Your Project/Prompt Title]]

**Use Case**‚Äã
[[Describe what this prompt/tool is for and the specific leadership challenge or task it helps address. For instance, "This prompt helps generate a starting draft for performance review feedback based on key achievements and areas for development."]]

**Prompt(s)**‚Äã
[[Paste your complete prompt(s) here. If there are multiple prompts or a sequence, explain how they work together. Ensure they are formatted clearly, perhaps using Markdown code blocks.]]

---
*(If your project includes more than just prompts, e.g., scripts or configuration files, you can add a section here to describe those files and how to use them.)*
---

**LLMs Used**‚Äã
[[List the Large Language Model(s) you've tested this prompt/tool with (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.). This helps others know what to expect.]]

**Sample Reply**‚Äã
[[Optional but highly recommended: Include a sample reply from the LLM when using your prompt. This is very helpful for users to understand the expected output and quality. Use Markdown formatting for readability.]]

**Author**‚Äã
[[your-git-username]]
